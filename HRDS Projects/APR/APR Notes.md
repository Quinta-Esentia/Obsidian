Hello and Happy Friday! !☀️

Peter our CFO has been looking through the charts from the APR PowerBI overnight and has asked for some simple stats analysis on the APR data we have. This is what he's asked for:

- what is the correlation between Leader time in role and CuEq100/FTE metric for:
    
    - Iron Ore (overall)
    - Gove Aluminium Operations
    - Kitimat Aluminium Operations
    - Diavik Diamond Operations
    - Kennecott Utah Copper Operations
    - Oyu Tolgoi Copper Operations
        
- what is the correlation between CuEq100/FTE and a) planned absence b) unplanned absence for:
    
    - all Rio Tinto
    - Borates Operations
    - Aluminium P155 Group
    - Iron Ore (PG level)
    - Boyne Aluminium Smelters
    - Gove Aluminium Smelters
    - Aluminium Saguenay Vaudreuil   
        
- What is the correlation for CuEq100/FTE and training compliance qualification for
    
    - All Rio Tinto
    - Aluminium Atlantic Operations
    - Aluminium ISAL Operations
    - Aluminium Yarwun Operations
    - Kennecott Utah Copper Operations
    - Iron Ore (PG level)
    - RTIT (Rio Tinto Iron and Titanium)
        
- Regarding training compliance qualification, Peter wondered if the relationship between CuEq100/FTE and training compliance may be due to an annual cycle. He asked if there is any way to normalise this so we can control for time of the year to understand the relationship a bit better.
    
- what is the correlation between leader turnover and eSAT?
    
- Regarding Leader turnover, he was very interested in this, because it was high in 2018-2020 and seem to have dropped for 2021 and 2022 if you look at Rio tinto overall. He is trying to get a sense of whether we are at low levels now, if it is stable now. I think from your conversation Joe, there are some pockets where it is very high now and others where it is not. Could he have some descriptive stats on the leader turnover across sites please from 2018 to now? Showing the spread?
    
- Last thing is the average age. Please could he have the correlation between CuEq100/FTE and a) average age b) leader average age for:
    
    - Rio Tinto
    - Aluminium
    - Commercial
    - Copper  
    - Iron Ore
    - Minerals

He is quite keen to talk to ExCo about this so if you could treat this as a priority I would really appreciate it. Could you please let me know how long you think it would take so I can set his expectation?

thanks again for all your help on this. It's quite exciting that this work is going to be discussed at ExCo!

Best wishes,

Kirsten
