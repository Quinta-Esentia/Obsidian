Fojtik, Rachel (RTS):

On the basis of Data Privacy Standard 4 sensitive information is a type of personal data that is of a particularly private nature and includes (among other things) personal data about a person’s race, ethnic origins, trade union membership and health and biometric information, as well as criminal-record information. We must ensure that sensitive information is processed only when necessary and only if:

• the data subject consents; or

• if processing is:

- required in order to comply with our legal obligations,
- is expressly permitted under local data privacy laws or local labour laws and the relevant personal data originates in that jurisdiction; or
- necessary to prevent or lessen a serious and imminent threat to the life, health or safety of any person.

The processing of indigenous status as a compliance measure for RioTinto in Australia, will probably be allowed since it is required in order to comply with RT’s legal obligations, as long as the data are processed within the scope of the applicable legal obligation and in accordance with data privacy law requirements (such as data security, data retention times and data quality and data minimisation principles). The same will apply according to the GDPR.

There are a few constraints around this again this is provided by the privacy team

DPP 4 - Sensitive information 

1. Processing is strictly necessary 

2. Consent is obtained OR another legal basis applies 

Notes/actions

Do not retain or store sensitive information except for the above reasons and ensure that if such information is intended to be used, anonymize and aggregate the data.
