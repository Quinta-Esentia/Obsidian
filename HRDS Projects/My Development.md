# Catch up with Melissa 
- Do I need to do databricks course in prep for databricks event in Sydney?
- 
## What can she do for me?

- Help mentor/guide me on direction where my goals can align with the teams: i.e. do I keep learning a variety of skills in different projects, vs dive deeper into one project, focus on specializing a specific skill (statistics, NLP). 

- Mentor me on skills (statistical modelling, time series method, R programming) - resources or helping find gaps in my knowledge etc. 

- schedule a regular (fortnightly?) catch up to go over project updates and development goals. 

- Help give me feedback on my strengths weaknesses.
