# Meeting with Dan and Mel

- Did Respectful Behaviours #sentiment analysis a couple of years ago in 2021 when a grad in Iron ore working under #Margaret-Loftus-Hills  . 
	- Adapted that work for flagging comments mentioning [[ERT]], and updated the model (as LLM progression has been vast in this time) using [[Hugging-Face]]. 


- Intended as a one off but happy to collaborate with others working in this space. 
- Can also send you the flagged #people-survey comments for members of the ERT who may be interested in reading them.
